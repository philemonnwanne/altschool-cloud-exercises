## Exercise 6

### Task: 
Review the CIS benchmark for ubuntu, and try to implement at least 10 of the recommendations that has been made within the benchmark.

### Focus Areas:
For hardening my linux system I decided to pick 12 recommendations cutting across the areas listed below

1. Initial Setup
2. Services
3. Network Configuration
4. Logging and Auditing
5. Access, Authentication and Authorization
6. System Maintenance

#### Note: 
> Due to the broad assumption of the guidance that operations are being performed as the root user, 
as well in order not to produce unexpected results or failure to make the the intended changes, 
I made sure I was logged in as the root user while performing all operations.
